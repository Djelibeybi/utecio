# UtecIO Python Library
UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Python library for interacting with Utec devices and Ultraloq locks.

This library is in initial development and will change rapidly. Development will initially be focused on the UL1-BT and other MD5 Encryption Based BLE locks with further locks added slowly as more functions are implimented.

If you have a specific lock request you can contribute at [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/maeneak) or [coindrop](https://coindrop.to/maeneak) to assist with purchasing of new locks for testing and accelerate development.
